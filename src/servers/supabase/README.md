3. Go to **Organization Settings** (from the dropdown menu)
4. In the sidebar, click on **OAuth Apps**
5. Click the **Add Application** button
6. Fill out the application details:
   - **Application Name**: e.g., `guMCP Integration`
   - **Authorization callback URLs**: Your redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`)
   - **Website URL**: Your application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
7. Select the following permissions:
   - **Organizations**: Organizations and all its members (Read and write)
   - **Projects**: Metadata, upgrade status, network restrictions and network bans (Read and write)

### 🔑 Obtaining Project ID and Service Role Key

For storage operations, you'll need to use your project's reference ID and service role API key:

1. **Log in to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)**
2. Select the **Project** you want to work with
3. Go to **Project Settings** in the sidebar
4. Click on **API** in the settings menu
5. In the **Project API Keys** section, you'll find:
   - **Project Reference ID**: The unique identifier for your project (displayed in the URL and in the Project Settings)
   - **Project API Keys**: 
     - Look for the key labeled **service_role secret** 
     - Click the **Copy** button next to it
6. Save these values to use with the storage tools (create_storage_bucket, list_storage_buckets, etc.)

> ⚠️ **Important**: The service_role key has admin rights to your entire project. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.

### 📄 Local OAuth Configuration

Create a file named `oauth.json` in your directory (local_auth/oauth_configs/supabase/) with the following content:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-oauth-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-oauth-client-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri"
}
```

---

### 🔓 Authenticate with Supabase

Run the following command to initiate the OAuth login:

```bash
python src/servers/supabase/main.py auth
```

This will open your browser and prompt you to log in to Supabase. After successful authentication, the access credentials will be saved locally to:

```
local_auth/credentials/supabase/local_credentials.json
```

### 🛠 Features

This server exposes tools grouped into the following categories:

#### 🏢 Organization Management

- `list_organizations` – List all organizations you are a member of

#### 📂 Project Management

- `list_projects` – List all your Supabase projects
- `get_project` – Get details of a specific project
- `create_project` – Create a new Supabase project

#### 🗄️ Storage Management

- `create_storage_bucket` – Create a new storage bucket
- `list_storage_buckets` – List all storage buckets in a project
- `get_storage_bucket` – Get details of a specific bucket
- `delete_storage_bucket` – Delete a storage bucket

---

### ▶️ Running the Server and Client

#### 1. Start the Server

```bash
./start_sse_dev_server.sh
```

Make sure you've already authenticated using the `auth` command.

#### 2. Run the Client

```bash
python tests/clients/RemoteMCPTestClient.py --endpoint=http://localhost:8000/supabase/local
```

### 📌 Notes on Supabase API Usage

- The server interacts with Supabase's management API for project/org operations
- Storage operations require a project-specific service_role API key
- Service_role keys should be used carefully and never exposed in client code
- The API uses standard REST endpoints for all operations
- Resource-level permissions apply in Supabase projects
- For storage operations, bucket-level permissions and RLS policies apply

### ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. For all storage operations, you must use a service_role key, not an anon key
2. You can find your service_role key in the Supabase Dashboard under Project Settings → API
3. Service_role keys have full admin access to your project, so keep them secure
4. Use RLS policies to secure your storage buckets properly
