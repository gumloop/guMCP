# Zoom GuMCP Server

GuMCP server implementation for interacting with Zoom Meetings API using OAuth authentication.

---

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Zoom OAuth App created at [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create)
- A local OAuth config file with your Zoom credentials

Create a file at the path `local_auth/oauth_configs/zoom/oauth.json`:

```json
{
  "web": {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
    "auth_uri": "https://zoom.us/oauth/authorize",
    "token_uri": "https://zoom.us/oauth/token",
    "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost:8080/callback"]
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit this file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore`.**

---

### üîê Authentication

Before running the server, you need to authenticate and store your OAuth token:

```bash
python src/servers/zoom/main.py auth
```

This will:
1. Print a Zoom OAuth URL for you to open in your browser.
2. Prompt you to authenticate with your Zoom account.
3. After authorization, you'll be redirected to the callback URL code.
4. Copy that code from your browser and paste it back in the terminal.
5. The token will be stored securely for future use.

You only need to do this once, unless your token expires.

> **Note**: Due to Zoom's URL length limitations, the authorization URL will only include minimal scopes. However, your app will have access to all scopes configured in the Zoom App Marketplace.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

#### Local Development

You can launch the server for local development using:

```bash
python -m mcp.main --server zoom-server
```

This will start the GuMCP server and make it available for integration and testing.

If you have a local client for testing, you can run it like:

```bash
python tests/clients/RemoteMCPTestClient.py --endpoint=http://localhost:8000/zoom-server/local
```

#### Example: Creating a Meeting

```
call ZOOM_CREATE_A_MEETING --topic "Team Meeting" --start_time "2025-05-25T15:00:00Z" --duration 60 --agenda "Weekly team sync"
```

#### Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/servers/zoom/tests.py -v
```

### üìé Notes

- The server requires OAuth authentication for improved security.
- Make sure your Zoom app has the following scopes configured in the Zoom App Marketplace:
  - `meeting:write:meeting`
  - `meeting:write:meeting:admin`
  - `meeting:read:meeting:admin`
  - Plus any additional scopes needed for your specific use case
- All dates should be in ISO format with timezone (e.g., `2025-05-25T15:00:00Z`)
- The server handles automatically adding timezone information if missing
